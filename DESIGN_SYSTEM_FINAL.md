# Final Design System - Black, White & Gold-Green with Selective Rounding

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Sharp structure. Soft interactions. Professional aesthetic.**

A balanced approach combining:
- **Sharp structural elements** - Cards, containers, main layout (0px or minimal rounding)
- **Soft interactive elements** - Buttons, inputs, badges (subtle rounding for usability)
- **High contrast** - Pure black and white base
- **Luxe accents** - Gold and forest green for sophistication

## 📐 Border Radius Strategy

### When to Use Sharp Edges (0px)
- Main navigation borders
- Page containers
- Section dividers
- Large structural elements
- Hero sections

### When to Use Rounded Edges

**Small (4px) - `rounded-sm`:**
- Badges
- Tags
- Small indicators
- Chips

**Medium (6px) - `rounded-md`:**
- Buttons
- Input fields
- Form elements
- Small cards
- Dropdown items

**Large (8px) - `rounded-lg`:**
- Cards
- Modals
- Popovers
- Dialogs
- Large containers

## ✅ What Changed from Full Sharp Design

### Before (All Sharp):
- ❌ All elements had 0px radius
- ❌ Buttons felt too harsh
- ❌ Inputs looked too rigid
- ❌ Less user-friendly

### After (Selective Rounding):
- ✅ Structure remains sharp (navbar, containers)
- ✅ Interactive elements are rounded (buttons, inputs)
- ✅ Better usability and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Modern yet professional

---

## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why Sharp Structure?
- **Professional:** Clean, geometric lines
- **Modern:** Contemporary design language
- **Distinctive:** Stands out from typical rounded designs
- **Organized:** Clear visual hierarchy

### Why Rounded Interactions?
- **Usability:** Easier to identify clickable elements
- **Comfort:** Softer on the eyes for frequent interactions
- **Familiar:** Users expect rounded buttons/inputs
- **Accessible:** Better visual affordance

---

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

All rounding scales appropriately:
- **Mobile:** Same rounding values (touch-friendly)
- **Tablet:** Same rounding values
- **Desktop:** Same rounding values

Maintains consistency across all screen sizes.

## 🎨 Quick Reference

```css
/* Tailwind Classes */
rounded-none  → 0px     (structural elements)
rounded-sm    → 4px     (badges, tags)
rounded-md    → 6px     (buttons, inputs)
rounded-lg    → 8px     (cards, modals)
```

---

## 💡 Usage Guidelines

### Do's
✅ Use sharp edges for main structure
✅ Use rounded edges for interactive elements
✅ Keep rounding consistent within component types
✅ Use smaller rounding for smaller elements
✅ Maintain high contrast colors

### Don'ts
❌ Don't over-round (no rounded-full on rectangles)
❌ Don't mix sharp and rounded randomly
❌ Don't use rounded-xl or rounded-2xl
❌ Don't round structural borders
❌ Don't soften the color palette
