# Manual Setup Required

This document outlines the manual steps you need to complete to get the GeoSynth application fully functional.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Database Setup

### 1. **Supabase Database Migration**

The database schema is already defined in `supabase/migrations/20251006173259_0680768c-41fd-4bbc-95fe-cc52e2e56eab.sql`

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "e:\mansi\7th sem\GeoSynth"

# Run the migration (if you have Supabase CLI installed)
supabase db push

# OR manually run the SQL in Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to SQL Editor
# 4. Copy and paste the contents of the migration file
# 5. Click "Run"
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# API Keys (Optional but recommended for full functionality)
VITE_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=your_exchangerate_api_key
VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

**Where to get these:**

1. **Supabase Credentials:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

2. **ExchangeRate API (Free tier available):**
   - Sign up at https://www.exchangerate-api.com/
   - Get your free API key
   - 1,500 requests/month on free tier

3. **News API (Free tier available):**
   - Sign up at https://newsapi.org/
   - Get your API key
   - 100 requests/day on free tier

4. **Weather API (Free tier available):**
   - The app uses Open-Meteo which doesn't require an API key
   - No action needed for weather
